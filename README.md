# vulnerability-calculator
A vulnerability calculator, it's really that simple.

## Supporting algorithms
At the moment, this only supports CWSS. It uses the cwssjs library under the
covers, and primarily is a UI code leveraging the cwssjs library. Additional
algorithms may be supported in the future if there is a desire.

**Note on CWSS Score** There is not qualitative scoring for CWSS per the spec,
whereas CVSS does define this. Since this is the case, CWSS has had it's
qualitative scoring implemented based on CVSSv3.1 - all ranges were multiplied
by 10 to achieve the equivalent scale used by CWSS.

## Usage
Currently, there is no container, so it will require Node.js and NPM.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute. There are definitely some additional features that
would be helpful, but aren't entirely necessary.
